To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Download Node.JS
Visit the official [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en) website and download the **LTS Version**. The local development uses version `v20.9.0`, but any version higher than this should work successfully (e.g., `v22.13.0`).

### 2. Download Git
Go to [Git Download for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and download the **64-bit version**.

We recommend using `pnpm` to manage packages. Install the dependencies with:
```Shell
pnpm install
```

**Note**: 
  - Use this command only when you change the `package.json`, add/update new dependencies, or the first time you run the project.
  - Once you run `pnpm install`, you should be able to see that it will generate one folder: `node_modules`, and one file: `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

#### If your device is a fresh install environment/without `pnpm`, please run the installation below to your global environment first:

```Shell
npm install -g pnpm
```
```Shell
pnpm setup
```

#### If you want to remove a package or all packages:
**Remove the specified package(s):**
`CMD`, `PowerShell`, `Git Bash`, or `Shell(Terminal)`:
```Shell
pnpm remove <PackageName1> <PackageName2> <PackageName3...>
```

**Remove all packages(If something is wrong in your localhost):**
**Notes BEFORE YOU RUN:**
  - ONLY Works on `PowerShell(Windows)`, or `Terminal(Linux)`
  - You just need to copy and paste the following commands,
  - if you are not familiar with them please do not modify any of the commands.
  - For Windows systems, you can also delete the corresponding folder directly by right-clicking on it in the graphical interface (due to the file system, deletion of the `node_modules` folder may time out or take a long time).
  - THINK FIRST, THEN DECIDED RUN OR NOT

```Shell
rm ./pnpm-lock.yaml
```
```Shell
rm ./node_modules
```

### 6. Run the Website
Start the `development` server with:
```Shell
pnpm run dev
```
When the terminal displays the local preview link, the website is successfully running!

Build the `Production` environment & Upload it to the server:
```Shell
pnpm build
```
Then, all the static codes will located in the `/dist` folder. Upload them all to the server.
