## Running the Project
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Download Node.JS
Visit the official [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en) website and download the **LTS Version**. The local development uses version `v20.9.0`, but any version higher than this should work successfully (e.g., `v22.13.0`).

### 2. Download Git
Go to [Git Download for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and download the **64-bit version**.

### 3. Pull the Project to Local
Clone the repository using the following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/1834423612/Team-695-OfficialWebsite.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```Shell
cd Team-695-OfficialWebsite
```

### 4. Install Project Dependencies
We recommend using `pnpm` to manage packages. Install the dependencies with:
```Shell
pnpm install
```
**Note**: Use this command only when you change the `package.json` or the first time you run the project.

### 5. Run the Website
Start the development server with:
```Shell
pnpm run dev
```
When the terminal displays the local preview link, the website is successfully running!

  </div>
  ...
</template>
